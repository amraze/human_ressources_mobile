To install the project open it up vs-code or android studio,
you may need to go to vscode settings -> Flutter Run Additional Args and add this line: --no-souns-null-safety
next, choose the device you want to install the app in and run main file contained in front/lib/main_pages/main.dart
that's it you have your app installed now.
